Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

Obtain a Toucan pool token such as BCT or NCT (by performing a token\n *    swap).\n * 2. Redeem the pool token for a TCO2 token.\n * 3. Retire the TCO2 token.\n *\n * These steps are combined in each of the following \"auto offset\" methods\n * implemented in `OffsetHelper` to allow a retirement within one transaction:\n * - `autoOffsetPoolToken()` if the user already owns a Toucan pool\n *   token such as BCT or NCT,\n * - `autoOffsetExactOutETH()` if the user would like to perform a retirement\n *   using MATIC, specifying the exact amount of TCO2s to retire,\n * - `autoOffsetExactInETH()` if the user would like to perform a retirement\n *   using MATIC, swapping all sent MATIC into TCO2s,\n * - `autoOffsetExactOutToken()` if the user would like to perform a retirement\n *   using an ERC20 token (USDC, WETH or WMATIC), specifying the exact amount\n *   of TCO2s to retire,\n * - `autoOffsetExactInToken()` if the user would like to perform a retirement\n *   using an ERC20 token (USDC, WETH or WMATIC), specifying the exact amount\n *   of token to swap into TCO2s.\n *\n * In these methods, \"auto\" refers to the fact that these methods use\n * `autoRedeem()` in order to automatically choose a TCO2 token corresponding\n * to the oldest tokenized carbon project in the specfified token pool.\n * There are no fees incurred by the user when using `autoRedeem()`, i.e., the\n * user receives 1 TCO2 token for each pool token (BCT/NCT) redeemed.\n *\n * There are two `view` helper functions `calculateNeededETHAmount()` and\n * `calculateNeededTokenAmount()` that should be called before using\n * `autoOffsetExactOutETH()` and `autoOffsetExactOutToken()`, to determine how\n * much MATIC, respectively how much of the ERC20 token must be sent to the\n * `OffsetHelper` contract in order to retire the specified amount of carbon.\n *\n * The two `view` helper functions `calculateExpectedPoolTokenForETH()` and\n * `calculateExpectedPoolTokenForToken()` can be used to calculate the\n * expected amount of TCO2s that will be offset using functions\n * `autoOffsetExactInETH()` and `autoOffsetExactInToken()`.\n */\ncontract OffsetHelper is OffsetHelperStorage {\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Contract constructor.
