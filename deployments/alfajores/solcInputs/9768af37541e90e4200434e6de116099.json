Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n * constructor() {\n *     _disableInitializers();\n * }\n * ```\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract Initializable {\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\n     */\n    uint8 private _initialized;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initializing;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\n     */\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

Obtain a Toucan pool token e.g., NCT (by performing a token\n *    swap on a DEX).\n * 2. Redeem the pool token for a TCO2 token.\n * 3. Retire the TCO2 token.\n *\n * These steps are combined in each of the following \"auto offset\" methods\n * implemented in `OffsetHelper` to allow a retirement within one transaction:\n * - `autoOffsetPoolToken()` if the user already owns a Toucan pool\n *   token e.g., NCT,\n * - `autoOffsetExactOutETH()` if the user would like to perform a retirement\n *   using native tokens e.g., MATIC, specifying the exact amount of TCO2s to retire (only on Polygon, not on Celo),\n * - `autoOffsetExactInETH()` if the user would like to perform a retirement\n *   using native tokens, swapping all sent native tokens into TCO2s (only on Polygon, not on Celo),\n * - `autoOffsetExactOutToken()` if the user would like to perform a retirement\n *   using an ERC20 token (cUSD, USDC, WETH or WMATIC), specifying the exact amount\n *   of TCO2s to retire,\n * - `autoOffsetExactInToken()` if the user would like to perform a retirement\n *   using an ERC20 token (cUSD, USDC, WETH or WMATIC), specifying the exact amount\n *   of token to swap into TCO2s.\n *\n * In these methods, \"auto\" refers to the fact that these methods use\n * `autoRedeem()` in order to automatically choose a TCO2 token corresponding\n * to the oldest tokenized carbon project in the specfified token pool.\n * There are no fees incurred by the user when using `autoRedeem()`, i.e., the\n * user receives 1 TCO2 token for each pool token (BCT/NCT) redeemed.\n *\n * There are two `view` helper functions `calculateNeededETHAmount()` and\n * `calculateNeededTokenAmount()` that should be called before using\n * `autoOffsetExactOutETH()` and `autoOffsetExactOutToken()`, to determine how\n * much native tokens e.g., MATIC, respectively how much of the ERC20 token must be sent to the\n * `OffsetHelper` contract in order to retire the specified amount of carbon.\n *\n * The two `view` helper functions `calculateExpectedPoolTokenForETH()` and\n * `calculateExpectedPoolTokenForToken()` can be used to calculate the\n * expected amount of TCO2s that will be offset using functions\n * `autoOffsetExactInETH()` and `autoOffsetExactInToken()`.\n */\ncontract OffsetHelper is OffsetHelperStorage {\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n    // Chain ID of Celo mainnet\n    uint256 private constant CELO_MAINNET_CHAINID = 42220;\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted upon successful redemption of TCO2 tokens from a Toucan\n     * pool token e.g., NCT.\n     *\n     * @param sender The sender of the transaction\n     * @param poolToken The address of the Toucan pool token used in the\n     * redemption,  e.g., NCT\n     * @param tco2s An array of the TCO2 addresses that were redeemed\n     * @param amounts An array of the amounts of each TCO2 that were redeemed\n     */\n    event Redeemed(\n        address sender,\n        address poolToken,\n        address[] tco2s,\n        uint256[] amounts\n    );\n\n    modifier onlyRedeemable(address _token) {\n        require(isRedeemable(_token), \"Token not redeemable\");\n\n        _;\n    }\n\n    modifier onlySwappable(address _token) {\n        require(isSwappable(_token), \"Path doesn't yet exists.\");\n\n        _;\n    }\n\n    modifier nativeTokenChain() {\n        require(\n            block.chainid != CELO_MAINNET_CHAINID,\n            \"The function is not available on this network.\"\n        );\n\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Contract constructor.
